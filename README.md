IOIOheli
========

RC Helicopter piloted by Android and IOIO

API Keys in the apiConfig.java file, to enable working with demo keys, refactor/rename apiConfigTemplate.java to apiConfig.java.

*Note:* This is in super-alpha development. Currently helicopter flies using the Web interface in "site" folder.
Hopefully future updates will make this forkable.

TODO:

- Many things for the repo, some github scripts so less of a hack required to get API keys working (see above), better documentation, etc.
- Rotation Gyro and GPS.
